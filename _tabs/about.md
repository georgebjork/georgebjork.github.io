## Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is George Bjork. I am a full stack software developer based out of Spokane, Washington. I primarily specialize in ASP.NET, but I also have done work with various other languages and frameworks, such as Flutter. In my free time I enjoy playing golf at my local golf courses, and going to breweries with my friends! 

Here on this page, you will find a summary of some of the work I've done, as well as blogs documenting work I've done previsouly for future refrence, and for anyone else who may stumble upon it.
